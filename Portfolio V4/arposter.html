                <h7>Objective</h7>
                
                <p>In the third sprint we decided to create the Augmented Reality Posters. This would be used primarly on snapchat, but could also be used in snapchat. Next to that we also created some personas to understand the customer journey.</p>
                <h7>Execution</h7>
                <p>The idea of the posters was to make a design that would then be recognized by snapchat and then when the user scans the poster with their camera, the poster would come to life. Giving tourdates and bringing people into the world of the Nachtwakers. Music will start playing, they start to move in the poster and completely enhance the poster experience </p>
                <p>We first started to make these 3D models of every band member in a program called Fuse. This would then be imported into the Lens studio program. A program that allows you to create custom filters for Snapchat.</p>
                <p>On the right you can see an example of how I wanted it to look like. The user would have to scan the Snapchat code first. And then the animation starts.</p>

                <p>On the right you can see the a 3D model of Niels. It is not complete accurate, becasue my computer would constantly crash. But I tried to get some elements in there of him. These models would ultimately be used in the Augemented Reality Posters.</p>

                <h2>A.R Setup v1</h2>
                <p>Using the lens studio, I started to to experiment with the setup of the lens. There is a 3D space and I just imported 3D models that I downloaded from Mixamo. Mixamo has a huge library of characters and animations. It lets you import the 3D models and add an animation.</p>
                <p>The only problem was the the lens only allowed 4MB files or lower and the 3D models that I made were about 10MB. That is why I chose these simple characters to start with the setup.</p>
                <p>In the two images on the right you can see how the band will appear in the Snapchat lens. I wanted it to look like they were actually preforming. </p>

                <h2>A.R Setup v2</h2>
                <p>In this next itteration I changed the setup a little bit. The lead singer and guitarist is all the way in the front. Pianist on the left, drummer in the back and the bassist right behind the lead singer.</p>
                <p>I found this to be a more realistic band setup. But still was still not working with a Snapchat code.</p>

                <p>In this next itteration I added only Kevin to the setup and created a box around him. To give the user the feeling that he is playing in a box in a wall. </p>
                <p>In the back of the setup you can see one of the pictures of the Nachtwakers that Benjamin took. I used this as the image tracking, therefore the user can point the camera to the image and the animation would start.</p>
                <p>On the right you can see that the model exceeds the limit size. </p>

                <p>In this next itteration I added removed the 3D model and imported a simple character. I added some colors and made the box a little heigher. </p>
                <p>The image tracking was actived in this step and as soon as the user scans the code, they are able to see the animation.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Working in a 3D envoirment proved to be quite difficult. I followed some tutorials on Lens studio. I did not know it was even possible to create your own lenses for Snapchat. I've used Snapchat lenses before, but I was not really impressed by them. I thought it was quite childish.</p>
                <p>Using the a lens as a makreting strategy is pretty effective when your target audience is young. I would love to learn more about designing in a 3D space and this is something I would definitely like to work on more in the future.</p>
