                            <p> The ‘Nachwakers’ are a ska reggae band and only preform at night. They are quite new and we have never seen or heard of them before.</p>

<p>In this stage it is imperative to go to one of their live concerts. That is, if they do have live performances.
    While we listen to the band, we also gather information from the people attending this performance or concert.</p>
<p>This could be done with a simple interview.
    After gathering information from the listeners, we would also interview the band so we could put these questions side by and show the band the information that we gathered.</p> 
<p>
Is this their first time listening to this band?
What do the listener think of this band?
What do they feel while they listen to this band?
    Who does the band sound like? Do they sound like another band that they know?</p>

                            <p>4.	On the radio or from other people that shared it with me in person.</p>
                            <p>I dont really know anything about Spotify and it takes to long to download things from YouTube </p>
                            <p>5.	Yes, North Sea Jazz.</p>

                            <p>8.	They sound a lot like Doe maar, but weaker.The voice isnt strong enough but it sounds like a famous song.</p>
                            <p>9.	The music itself is stronger than the text.</p>
                            <p>10.  It just really makes me feel young again like in the 80's.</p>

                            <p>1.	Rock, pop and R&B.</p>

                            <p>7.   Yes it sounds a lot like Doe Maar, but a bit newer</p>
                            <p>8.   They come pretty close to Doe Maar, very similar.</p>
                            <p>9.  The music is great but I didn't expect this when I saw the logo.</p>
                            <p>10.  Fun/festival</p>

    <h3 class="col-md-8">Conclusion</h3>
                        <div class="col-md-8">
                        

                            <p> It becomes apparent that some people think that the Nachtwakers sounds a lot like Doe Maar. The same vibe, the same intro almost the same voice.</p>

<p>This led us to believe that they want to be assosciated with the colors of Doe Maar, but Kevin really did not want that at all. He wanted a more minimalistic black and white logo.
   </p>
<p>Interviewing these people made us realize that every young and old would really like this music. But of course in order to gain some popularity we would have to target the younger audience, since they use Spotify and YouTube a lot more. In order for us to really brand the Nachtwakers, we thought it would be best to change the logo, give it a bit more ska/reggae and festival vibe.</p> 
<p>
And finally we also concluded that most people would say that this music would be played at festivals. So that would be another idea for the Nachtwakers to take into consideration. People of all ages would enjoy this music, whether its reminiscing the 80's Doe Maar or a nice festival song they would enjoy.</p>
