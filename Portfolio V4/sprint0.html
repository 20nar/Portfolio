<p1>Objective</p1>
                        <p>In this first sprint we first had to understand who the Nachtwakers are. We created some Artistic Explorations and Brandguide Inspirations to fully understand the band.</p>
                        <p1>Execution</p1>
                        <p>The nachtwakers is a Ska/Regga band from Tilburg. They're in their final years of the Fontys Rock Academy. Like the name implies, they always play and make music at night. After seeing the logo and the pictures of the band we realized it was quite minimalistic and black and white. Espescially when you look at the logo and the clothes they were wearing. The music sounds like it could be played at a festival. The pop/reggae vibes are very apparent in the way they sound. This would definetely be great at a festival.</p>
                        <p1>Reflection</p1>
                        <p>We compared all of the moodboard of the group and grouped them in three different moodboards that we think fits best with the Nachtwakers.</p>
                          <li>Minimalistic Black and White</li>
                        <li>Festival</li>
                        <li>Neon lights and Night life

            <h3 class="col-md-6">Target group research</h3>
            <div class="col-md-8">
<p1>Objective</p1>
                <p>For our project we interviewed different people (19 people) of different ages. We all individually wrote a target group analysis and then merged it.</p>
                <p1>Execution</p1>
                <p>The Night Watchmen can best focus on festivals and not so much on concerts. The reason for this is that the interviewee finds the atmosphere of the music best suited to that.
                    They also go more to festivals than to concerts, especially when it comes to a band they don't know yet. The interviewees are more interested in the atmosphere of a festival than in knowing the bands they listen to. </p>
                <p>They think the atmosphere of the band fits with live cafes, a pleasant evening out and bright colors.
                    We noticed that the interviewees who used to like to listen to Doe Maar, find De Nachtwakers very much like Doe Maar. They like the music, but would not listen to De Nachtwakers in particular. They like it, but listen to Doe Maar for nostalgia.</p>
                <p>The largest group of those interviewed says they listen to music via YouTube and Spotify.
                    It is said that there is not much new music to be found on YouTube, because it automatically gives songs that you have already played. They look for a specific artist or song and do not go there specifically for new things.</p>
                <p>By doing desk research into the age of people who visit festivals, we have found that the largest group is between 20 and 35 years old. This group also goes to most festivals and is also most willing to make the effort to go to a festival.</p>
