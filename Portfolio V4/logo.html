    <div class="col-lg">
                <h2>Logo Design</h2>
                <p>Even though Kevin from the Nachtwakers told us that he did not really want the logo to be changed, he did tell us that we could mess around with it.</p><p>I did not know not know how to work with Illustrator or photoshop. I though this would be a good moment to challenge myself to redesign the logo.</p>
                <br>
               
                 </div>
    <div class="container-fluid padding">
        <div class="row padding">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h2>Original Logo</h2>
                <p>This is the original logo of the Nachtwakers. It is quite simple and it has a little moon at the end. It is very similar to a branding sign.</p>
                <p>I felt that this logo did not fit with their music. Very festive and energetic. This looks rather serious band or a DJ logo.</p>
                <br>
               
                 </div>

                <h2>Logo V1 </h2>
                <p>I started to mess around with the colors of the logo. This would give the band a more colorful aspect.</p>
                <p>You can also see that I experimented a bit with the moon of the band. I thought that their font of the original logo was a bit standard so I also experimented with other fonts. Giving a more playful aspect. I thought if Kevin did not want to let go of the logo, it was definitely because of the moon, since the font is such a standard font. The top one has the colors of reggae, even though Kevin said he did not want it. I made the colors a bit pastel. Therefore the reggae colors don't pop out and are less noticable.<p>The bottom logo is a bit bolder and that is why the Moon is partly inverted. This still makes the moon visible. </p>

                <h2>Logo V2</h2>
                <p>With this logo I wanted to make my own goofy font. Felt a little more playfull.</p>
                <p>I took away the colors and started to look at some inpspiration from ska bands. Ska is usually in black and white. In this logo I experimented with the font by designing it myself with the pen tool. This turned out to be quite challenging. Creating a consistent font-type in a logo proves to be quite difficult. </p>

                <h2>Logo V3</h2>
                <p>In this itteration I wanted to experiment with shapes. I grabbed the shape of the moon and started to put some circles on top. The colors represent each band member. This comes from the clothes that they were wearing in a picture that they sent us.</p>
                <p>The black circle is casting a shadow on the moon. This is as if they are "guarding the moon". </p>
                <p>The logos with the shield was from guarding the night as well, but this turned out to look like an antivirus.</p>

                <h2>Logo V4</h2>
                <p>In this itteration I also expiremented with the moon. The colors are also taken from the band members clothes. This turned out to look like an eyeball. Giving the idea that it is watching something and of course they are watching the night. But this turned out to look like a parrot. That wasn't the idea. Taking away the colors did proved to be a lot better, but it did not satisfy me.

                <h2>Logo V5</h2>
                <p>An owl is known for guarding the night. That is why I created this owl. The negative space between the eyebrow and the cheeks creates the eyes and nose of the owl. This still gives a guardian feel. The yellow color is from the moon. Even though it is not yellow in reall life, but it is yellow in some cartoons.</p><p>The other two logos have the ska element in there with the black and white. </p>

                <h2>Logo V6</h2>
                <p>In this itteration I grabbed the moon again and added mountains. This would mean that they are guarding the night as well. But this turned out to be too hectic and did not portray the Nachtwakers music. After that I added the owl. This looked a bit like another anitvirus. </p><p>In the last two logos I wanted to put the letters N and W of the Nachtwakers together to make an owl. But the letter N is not visible. This turned out to be quite interesting, but did not portray the bands music. </p>
                <p>The last logo looks once again like an antivirus, therefore I moved on and started all over again.</p>

                <h2>Logo V7</h2>
                <p>The first image was taken straight from google and I really liked that there was a cityscape of New York.</p>
                <p>Putting the cityscape in a logo would really give a hint of where the logo comes from. And the half circle is then the moon again. </p>
                <p>I drew a simple cityscape with a pen tool and added it on top of a bold font. The blue brings back the night feeling.</p>
                <p>In the last logo you can see that the negative space is the cityscape and the font is just an outline. This turned out great but I was not satisfied with it.</p>

                <h2>Final Logo</h2>
                <p>This is the final logo of Sprint 1. It is the same idea as the previous logo, but it is the actual cityscape of Tilburg. You can see every iconic building from Tilburg in there. Bahar was the one who designed the font. She grabbed a very open font and places a star ontop of the A. The negative space shows a star, but the letter A is still visible. The star is another hint towards the night feel. </p>
