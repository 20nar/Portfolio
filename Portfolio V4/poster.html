                <p>My idea for the poster was to make it fun and colorful. The colors that we chose are all across the poster. This will catch the attention of the one who sees it on the street or on a billboard. I got quite negative feedback from this poster. It seems to look like a chinese restaurant poster. With all the lines going everywhere. I took this design and started all over again.</p>

                <p>On the right you can see the a 3D model of Niels. It is not complete accurate, becasue my computer would constantly crash. But I tried to get some elements in there of him. These models would ultimately be used in the Augemented Reality Posters.</p>

                <h2>A.R Setup v1</h2>
                <p>Using the lens studio, I started to to experiment with the setup of the lens. There is a 3D space and I just imported 3D models that I downloaded from Mixamo. Mixamo has a huge library of characters and animations. It lets you import the 3D models and add an animation.</p>
                <p>The only problem was the the lens only allowed 4MB files or lower and the 3D models that I made were about 10MB. That is why I chose these simple characters to start with the setup.</p>
                <p>In the two images on the right you can see how the band will appear in the Snapchat lens. I wanted it to look like they were actually preforming. </p>

                <h2>A.R Setup v2</h2>
                <p>In this next itteration I changed the setup a little bit. The lead singer and guitarist is all the way in the front. Pianist on the left, drummer in the back and the bassist right behind the lead singer.</p>
                <p>I found this to be a more realistic band setup. But still was still not working with a Snapchat code.</p>

                <p>In this next itteration I added only Kevin to the setup and created a box around him. To give the user the feeling that he is playing in a box in a wall. </p>
                <p>In the back of the setup you can see one of the pictures of the Nachtwakers that Benjamin took. I used this as the image tracking, therefore the user can point the camera to the image and the animation would start.</p>
                <p>On the right you can see that the model exceeds the limit size. </p>

                <p>In this next itteration I added removed the 3D model and imported a simple character. I added some colors and made the box a little heigher. </p>
                <p>The image tracking was actived in this step and as soon as the user scans the code, they are able to see the animation.</p>
